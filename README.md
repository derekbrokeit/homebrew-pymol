homebrew-pymol
==========

This has been merged up to [homebrew-science](hbsci), so the complete installation of [pymol](pymol). 
This requires [homebrew](hb) for osx.

```
$ brew tap homebrew/science
$ brew install python --with-brewed-tk --enable-threads --with-x11
$ brew install pymol
```

Now you should be on your way to using the latest version of pymol!
